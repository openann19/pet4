GLOBAL WEB UX PATTERN V1
1. Semantic Structure & ARIA (applies to every page)

Every page MUST follow this landmark skeleton:

Exactly one <main> per page.

Optional <header>, <nav>, <footer>, <aside> as needed.

Every <main> MUST have an accessible name:

aria-label="X" or an <h1> as the first heading inside it.

Every visually distinct block MUST be:

A <section> with a heading, or

A <section aria-label="…"> if no visible heading.

Lists of similar items MUST use semantic lists:

Cards, tiles, rows → <ul> / <ol> with <li>.

Decorative images/icons:

Must have alt="" and aria-hidden="true".

Functional images/icons:

Must have descriptive alt or aria-label on their button/container.

Modals/popovers:

Must use role="dialog" or role="alertdialog",

Have aria-modal="true",

Have a programmatically associated title (either aria-labelledby or aria-label),

Trap focus while open and restore focus on close.

2. Keyboard & Interaction Rules (global, no exceptions)

Everything clickable MUST be keyboard-usable:

Use <button>, <a>, or role="button" + tabIndex={0} + Enter/Space handlers.

No click-only div/span.

Focus states:

Every interactive element MUST have a visible :focus-visible style that contrasts with background (e.g. focus ring).

Focus outline must not be removed without a replacement.

Logical tab order:

Follows visual hierarchy: nav → main sections → footers.

No tabIndex > 0; only 0 (custom focusable) or -1 (programmatic focus).

Global shortcuts:

Page-specific shortcuts are allowed, but:

Must not override basic browser shortcuts.

Must be documented (tooltip, settings, or help hint).

Any custom gesture (drag, swipe) MUST have button/keyboard equivalents.

3. Typography System (one global scale)

Single primary font across app (e.g. system/Inter); optional display font only for big headings.

Base font-size: 16px (1rem).

Allowed roles & tokens (no other random sizes):

display:

clamp(2.25rem, 3vw, 3rem); weight 700–800

Use: hero headings / main title.

h1:

clamp(1.75rem, 2.5vw, 2.25rem); weight 600–700

h2:

clamp(1.5rem, 2.1vw, 2rem); weight 600

h3:

1.25rem–1.5rem; weight 500–600

body:

1rem; line-height ≥ 1.5

body-sm:

0.875rem; line-height ≥ 1.4

caption/hint:

0.75rem; line-height ≥ 1.4 (minimal text size).

Rules:

No text below 0.75rem.

Long-form text max width ~60ch (to avoid unreadable wide lines).

Use body or body-sm for any paragraph; no ad-hoc 13px, 15px etc.

Hierarchy: each page must have exactly one h1, then h2 / h3 in order (no skipping levels visually).

4. Color, Contrast & Elevation

Global color tokens only (design system palette):

Primary, secondary, accent, danger, warning, success, background, surface, border, text-primary, text-muted.

Components MUST NOT hardcode arbitrary hex except via tokens.

Contrast:

All interactive text and important content must meet WCAG AA:

Text on background: ≥ 4.5:1.

Text on images MUST sit on overlays (gradient or solid) to guarantee contrast.

Surfaces:

At most 3–4 elevation levels (e.g. base, raised, overlay, modal).

Shadows and blurs must come from that small set; no per-component custom values.

Semantic colors:

Error/destructive → danger token.

Success confirmations → success token.

Primary call-to-action → primary token (consistent across app).

5. Layout, Spacing & Responsiveness

Layout grid:

Content width limited by a container (e.g. max-width: 64rem–80rem).

Page content centered with padding on both sides (1rem–1.5rem).

Spacing scale (global):

Use a small set: 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 32 / 40 / 48 px.

Components must use these spacing tokens, not random pixel gaps.

Breakpoints:

At least:

sm: mobile, md: tablet, lg: desktop.

Layouts MUST not require horizontal scrolling on normal content; only for intentional carousels/strips.

Rules:

Vertical rhythm: consistent spacing between sections (e.g. 32–48px).

Forms and cards must not stretch beyond comfortable reading widths.

6. Components Global Rules (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.)

Buttons:

Must use a shared base style for:

Primary, secondary, ghost, destructive.

States required: default, hover, active, focus-visible, disabled.

Minimum size: 44×44 px touch area.

Text inside buttons: body or body-sm weight 500–600, never all-caps by default unless part of the brand.

Inputs:

Must have:

Visible label (<label>),

Optional helper text (id + aria-describedby),

Error message with clear styling and aria-invalid="true" when failing validation.

Click on label focuses the input.

Cards:

Use one global card pattern (padding, radius, shadow).

Cards that are clickable must:

Show hover & focus state,

Use either whole-card click or explicit CTA, not both.

7. Motion & Reduced Motion (global rule)

Motion is allowed only for:

Transitions between states (e.g. cards, modals),

Microinteractions (hover/press),

Feedback (toasts, notifications).

Timing:

Enter/exit / major transitions: 150–300ms.

Hover/press: 75–150ms.

No long, distracting animations > 500ms for core interactions.

Easing:

Use a standard set (e.g. ease-out, cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)), not random per component.

prefers-reduced-motion:

Must be respected globally:

Animations and transitions reduced to minimal or disabled.

No continuous looping motion for users with reduced-motion enabled.

8. Forms, Errors & Empty States

Each form:

Must have a title/heading that describes purpose,

Must provide per-field errors and (if relevant) a global error at top.

Error messages:

Plain, specific language (“Email is invalid”, “Password must be at least 8 characters”),

Not just a color change—text + icon or underline.

Empty states:

Must include:

A short title,

A one-line explanation,

Optional action (“Add X”, “Refresh”).

Decorative visuals optional, but must be marked decorative for screen readers.

9. Accessibility & Global Behavior

Every interactive page:

Must be navigable by keyboard only.

Must be usable with screen readers (labels, roles, focus order).

Focus management:

On route change:

Focus moves to main heading or main region.

On modal open:

Focus moves inside modal and is trapped.

On modal close:

Focus returns to the previously focused element.

Announcements:

Important one-off events (e.g. “Story created”, “Match found”) should be sent to a polite aria-live region.

10. Consistency Rule (the meta-rule)

For any new page / component:

If you define a new font size, color, radius, shadow, spacing, or motion curve that is not in the global set → that’s a violation.

If you introduce any interactive element that:

is not focusable,

has no visible focus state,

or has no clear ARIA label / semantic tag → that’s a violation.

If you add new motion that does not respect prefers-reduced-motion → violation.
