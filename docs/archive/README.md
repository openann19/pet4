# Archived Documentation

This directory contains archived documentation files that are no longer actively maintained but are kept for historical reference.

## Structure

- `implementation-summaries/` - Completed implementation summaries and status reports
- `migration-tracking/` - Migration tracking documents and progress reports
- `audit-reports/` - Audit reports and analysis documents

## Note

These files are archived because:
- They document completed work that is no longer actively tracked
- They contain historical information that may be useful for reference
- They have been superseded by the main `architecture.md` document

For current architecture documentation, see [`../../architecture.md`](../../architecture.md).
